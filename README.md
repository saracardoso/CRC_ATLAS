# CRC ATLAS

Scripts developed to construct the CRC atlas are organized as follows:

- __*0_initial_data_evaluation*__: quality control of each of the datasets used to construct the atlas;

- __*1_merge*__: merge and integration of the different datasets together into one;

- __*2_annotation*__: scripts being developed to annotate the cells
