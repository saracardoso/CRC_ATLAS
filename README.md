# CRC ATLAS

**For a detailed explanation on how we constructed the atlas and visualize it, access here: [UPCOMING].**

The scripts developed to construct the CRC atlas are organized in this project as follows:

- __*0_initial_data_evaluation*__: quality control of each of the datasets used to construct the atlas;

- __*1_merge*__: merge and integration of the different datasets together into one;

- __*2_annotation*__: annotation of the cells into the various cell-types

- __*3_generate_atlas_files*__: script to generate the final atlas files, made available at [UPCOMING]
